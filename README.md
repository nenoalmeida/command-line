# Command Line
Essential basic things about Command Line

A good guide to the ins and outs of the Unix command line from the perspective of a working developer rather than a Unix sysadmin.

I took all of this tricks od the book CONQUERING THE COMMAND LINE / Unix and Linux Commands for Developers by Mark Bates

The entire bookn is here http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book/basics

I hope you like it and i hope this could be so usefull as it is for me!
Thanks,
